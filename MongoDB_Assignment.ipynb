        "**Ans** - In **MongoDB**, a **collection** is a grouping of **documents**, and it is conceptually similar to a **table in relational databases**. However, unlike tables, collections do **not enforce a strict schema**, allowing documents within the same collection to have different structures.\n",

        "1. **Document Container**\n",

        "**Ans**- Using **MongoDB** for **horizontal scaling** offers several advantages, especially for applications that deal with **large datasets**, require **high availability**, and experience **variable or unpredictable traffic patterns**. Horizontal scaling in MongoDB is primarily achieved through **sharding**.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Horizontal scaling** means **adding more servers** to distribute the database load, as opposed to vertical scaling, which means upgrading the existing server’s hardware.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
